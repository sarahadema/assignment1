        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        
        <p class="dropcap">Rifle Paper Co. is a stationery and gift brand based in Winter Park, Florida founded by husband and wife team, Anna and Nathan Bond.</p>

<p>What began as a small business based out of Anna and Nathan's 1-bedroom apartment has quickly grown into a worldwide brand over the last four years. Our products feature Anna's whimsical designs which often include hand-painted illustrations and lettering to compose a style that feels both nostalgic and timeless.</p>

<p>All of our paper products are printed in the USA and are inspected and assembled by hand in our studio. We use FSC-certified paper stocks with recycled content, environmentally responsible printers, and select high quality materials that allow for products that are both well-made and enhance our designs. Everything that we create is well thought to ensure that we end up with a collection of products that we would not only use but are incredibly proud of.</p>
        
<p>We strongly believe life's personal stories and moments are best told through the gift of a hand-written card or note, and hope that our goods inspire you to share these moments with others. Please let us know if there's anything we can assist you with or ways that we can improve your shopping experience.</p>
